# ML_Linear_Algebra_Find_Similar_Clients

## Project description
The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to protect its clients' data. The
task is to develop a data transforming algorithm that would make it hard to
recover personal information from the transformed data. This is called data
masking, or data obfuscation. Additionally, the data should be protected in such a way that the
quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer. Follow these steps to develop a new algorithm:
construct a theoretical proof using properties of models and the given task;
formulate an algorithm for this proof.
Check that the algorithm is working correctly when applied to real data.
We will use a simple method of data masking, based on an invertible matrix.

## Data description
- Features: insured person's gender, age, salary, and number of family
members.
- Target: number of insurance benefits received by the insured person over the
last five years.
